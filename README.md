# QUOTE-GENERATOR
The Luck Generator is a simple and interactive web application built using React. It is designed to provide users with random positive or motivational messages, also known as “lucky messages,” with just one click. This app is a great way to learn the basics of React, especially how to use functional components and hooks like useState. When the user clicks the "Generate Luck" button, the app selects a random message from a predefined list and displays it on the screen instantly. The user interface is clean, responsive, and styled using inline CSS, making it easy to understand and customize. It’s a great beginner project for those new to frontend development or looking to build a fun, lightweight app that provides a positive user experience.
